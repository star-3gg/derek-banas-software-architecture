# 🧩 Design Patterns 2024 🧩
Welcome to the Design Patterns workout in multiple languages! 🏋️‍♂️ Inspired by the awesome Derek Banas. Check out his videos on [software design patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHpsC5ng_E&list=PL36enNxU148T1LqbycaineNGt6HUy2dXD&index=2).

## 🔮 Futuristic and Minimal Stack

## 🚀 C++ Implementations available
This project uses C++ implementations instead of the original Java implementation. It's like giving our patterns a new superpower!

## 🦀 Rust Implementations in Development
Coming soon!

## 🧪 Automated Testing
No more sleepless nights worrying about breaking changes! This project uses the Google Testing Framework to catch those sneaky bugs. 🐛

## 🏁 Prebuilt Binaries & Automatic Releases
Every time a new commit is pushed to the main branch, our CI/CD pipeline kicks in to automatically build and test the project. 
If everything checks out, a new release is created and published right here on our [releases page](https://github.com/star-3gg/derek-banas-software-architecture/releases).
Ensuring well tested and fast deployments. If you just want to see what a program does without having to compile the binaries yourself,
this is great for you. The exectuable binaries should run on **all major x86_64 Linux distributions** which means you can run the binary inside docker.
If a binary does not run on your machine, please let me know by creating a new issue on the [issue page](https://github.com/star-3gg/derek-banas-software-architecture/issues).

## 🐳 Containerized Environment
Dive into a seamless development experience! The environment for this project is fully containerized using docker-compose. 🌊

### 🛠 Scripts for Ease-of-Use
- `build.sh`: Builds the project inside of the container. 🏗️
- `clean-build-files.sh`: Cleans the build directory. 🧹

Let's make our code cleaner & more efficient 🚀
