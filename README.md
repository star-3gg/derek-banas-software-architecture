# 🧩 Design Patterns 2024 🧩
Welcome to the Design Patterns workout in multiple languages! 🏋️‍♂️ Inspired by the awesome Derek Banas. Check out his videos on [software design patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHpsC5ng_E&list=PL36enNxU148T1LqbycaineNGt6HUy2dXD&index=2).

## 🚀 Written in C++
This project uses C++ implementations instead of the original Java implementation. It's like giving our patterns a new superpower!

## 🧪 Automated Testing
No more sleepless nights worrying about breaking changes! This project uses the Google Testing Framework to catch those sneaky bugs. 🐛

## 🏁 Automatic Releases
Every time a new commit is pushed to the main branch, our CI/CD pipeline kicks in to automatically build and test the project. 
If everything checks out, a new release is created and published right here on our [releases page](https://github.com/star-3gg/derek-banas-software-architecture/releases).
Ensuring well tested and fast deployments.

## 🐳 Containerized Environment
Dive into a seamless development experience! The environment for this project is fully containerized using docker-compose. 🌊

### 🛠 Scripts for Ease-of-Use
- `build.sh`: Builds the project inside of the container. 🏗️
- `clean-build-files.sh`: Cleans the build directory. 🧹

Let's make our code cleaner & more efficient 🚀
