# Reviewing Basic & Advanced OOP Concepts

## What is a class?

A class is a blueprint for objects of said class.
Classes are split in two parts, fields and Methods.

### Fields

Fields are what an object of a class 'knows'.

### Methods

Methods are what an object of a class 'does'

### Example Class 'Animal'

This is an example of a simple class which represents the blueprint for an
animal object.
